Allows for manipulation of CSS elements in real-time using any NFC-enabled device. Early work in progress with the goal of building out a fun and educational game for children.

## How it Works

Program short numerical strings to any NFC tag that is compatible with your Android device. With the app opened on your phone simply tap an NFC tag. The corresponding action tied to the numerical code triggers an animation! In other words, tap a tag and watch the sun set. Tap another and watch the clouds roll in. Woo!!

## Why...really

Cheap inexpensive NFC tags can be stuck to books, onto toys, and all over the kitchen floor when parents look away! These tags could then trigger actions that tells a graphical story, causes toys' digital alter egos to come alive, or help make parents forget about the mess on the kitchen floor when they see their children smiling.

## What Was Used

AngularJS for the client-side, Firebase for backend service, DB, and deployment, and PhoneGap to wrap up and deploy on Android.
